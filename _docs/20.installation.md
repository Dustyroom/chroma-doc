  * In Unity, go to **Window** ▶︎ **Package Manager**;
  * On the top left, please find the **Packages** drop down menu. Select **My Assets** item there. You’ll find **Chroma** among your assets. Choose the version you’d like to import;
  * Click **Download** (if it is not downloaded yet);
  * Click **Import**.


## Quick Start Scene

The Quick Start scene is a good place to start if you are new to Chroma. It contains a few examples of the most common use cases for Chroma.

The Quick Start scene scene works in all Render Pipelines: Built-in, URP and HDRP.

## Troubleshooting

Below you can find typical possible issues when installing Chroma as well as other assets in Unity.

#### Can't import Chroma
- First of all, please make sure you downloaded Chroma using the _Package Manager_.
- If the 'Import' button is greyed out, it may be due to the known Package Manager 'cache' issue. Here is how to fix it:
  1. Please locate the **Readme** helper tool:
**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder ▶︎ select **Readme** and go to _Inspector_ panel;
  1. Press **Clear Cache**;
  1. Download and import Chroma from the _Package Manager_ or using _Reimport Chroma files_ button on the **Readme** file's Inspector panel.

#### After importing, Chroma gives errors
- First, try **restarting Unity**. A simple restart indeed sometimes fixes some strange issues.
- **Re-import Chroma**. Here is how:
  1. Please locate the **Readme** helper tool:
**Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder ▶︎ select **Readme** and go to _Inspector_ panel;
  1. Press **Clear Cache**;
  1. Delete the **Chroma** folder from the **Project** panel ▶︎ **Assets** folder;
  1. Download and import Chroma from the _Package Manager_ or using _Reimport Chroma files_ button on the **Readme** file's Inspector panel.
- Verify if the Unity version is equal or is newer than **2020.3.30f1**.
- Make sure that you are not using a Unity **beta** release.
- If nothing helps, please write to info@dustyroom.com and include the copied debug info from the **Readme** file, which is by default located in **Assets** folder ▶︎ **Chroma** folder (or just share a screenshot of the panel).

#### After importing, some of the shaders are missing or cannot be compiled
- Check whether your setup meets the [requirements](/limitations).
- Try a complete reimport for Chroma. [Here's how](#after-importing-chroma-gives-errors)
